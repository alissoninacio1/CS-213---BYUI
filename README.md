# CS-213---BYUI
These are the projects of CS 213 class, including HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. Include small web applications with client and server programming.  Other repositories will be created with complete projects in this GitHub profile. This is the reason I won't develop this README now.  These lines of code were only exercises, and not projects to show here.
