            The institute offers some courses related to the Olympics. Its main objective is to give students the opportunity to learn about and practice a different sport.
            For decades, Instituto Valerianno has been a supporter of the highest sporting standards, valuing access to less widespread sports among most schools, so its duty is to uphold these high principles.
