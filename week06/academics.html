      <h3>Aerospace Engineerig</h3>
      <p>
        Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the design, development, testing, and production of aircraft, spacecraft, and related systems and equipment. The field has traditionally focused on problems related to atmospheric and space flight.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Architecture, the art and technique of designing and building, as distinguished from the skills associated with construction. The practice of architecture is employed to fulfill both practical and expressive requirements, and thus it serves both utilitarian and aesthetic ends.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Astrophysics</h3>
      <p>
        The branch of astronomy concerned with the physical nature of stars and other celestial bodies, and the application of the laws and theories of physics to the interpretation of astronomical observations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Computer Engineerig</h3>
      <p>
        Computer engineering is the branch of engineering that integrates electronic engineering with computer sciences. Computer engineers design and develop computer systems and other technological devices.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
     <p>
        Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems, or power generation equipment.
     </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The study of history is a window into the past that provides understanding of the present-day, and how individuals, nations, and the global community might develop in the future. As well as how societies came to be and examines cultural, political, social, and economic influences.

      <h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Nuclear Physics</h3>
      <p>
        The branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics, distinguished from that of chemistry and biology, includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.
